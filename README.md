# What is This Project?
* This project is one of the main projects for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree.
* This is the final project for the "Backend" section of the course.
* We were instructed to create an "Item Catalog" website that provides a list of items within a variety of catgories.
* We also needed to provide a user registration and authentication system handled by third party OAuth providers like Google, Facebook etc.
* Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
* This project is to show that we can develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. We need to properly use the various HTTP methods available to us and relate them to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

# How can the code be run?
* Clone or Fork this repository.
* In your teminal window / command line type "python main.py"
* Open your web browser to http://localhost:8000/ and begin navigating the pages.
* You will need to have python 3, and the sqlalchemy and flask libraries installed to run this code.
* It is best if you have a Google, Facebook or other account with the third party OAuth providers.

# Troubleshhoting
* Make sure that you either have pyton 3, or you can run a virtual environment for it, or you convert the code to python 2.
